Package Tracker
==============
Package Tracker is used to keep track of packages in a college mailroom scenario. The application uses a barcode scanner to scan in packages and a RFID reader for quick student/employee pickup - I used a HID Omnikey-25CL for testing purposes and the format is currently only for H1301 HID cards.
